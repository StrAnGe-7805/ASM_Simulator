This is a read me file about our simulator.

* This is an assembly code siimulator.
* Size of the main memory is fixed and the value is 1024 bytes or 2**10 bytes.
* It has 2 levels of cache.
* It performs pipelining.
* Both the levels of the cache has same Block size. But size and associativity of both the levels of the cache can be of user's wish.
* Our simulator uses "Least recently used (LRU)" cache policy. And it is based on Exclusive cache.
